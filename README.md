# Clippy

Fork of ClipAngel (https://sourceforge.net/projects/clip-angel/, https://github.com/tormozit/ClipAngel). 

All credits to tormozit.

Use the original if you want working application without bugs.

Changes:
- upgraded to .NET 6
- using LiteDb instead of Sqlite
- removed a lot of unnecessary features (in my view) and dependecies
- compiled as a single exe, under 1MB
